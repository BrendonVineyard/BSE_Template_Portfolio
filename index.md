# Second Milestone
My second milestone is the increased accuracy of my robot. After my first milestone. I had put tape on the wheels because the pressure on the motors were too much for them to handle and that caused the robot to be very slow. Puttin tape on the wheels proved very efficient in increased speed and reliability. As for the sensor, I had recoded the distance for the waves that emanate for other surfaces so that the robot no longer comes too close into contact with something.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was being able to have the robot perform all the directions. Go back, go forwawrd, go left and go right, pretty straightforward. First of what I had to do was build the chassis for where all the components will be mounted and as for the motors to help move the robot. Then I wired and sodered the motors to the motor driver. This was tough since some of the output screws weren't budging so I had to get a new one. After wiring the motors to the driver, I wired the driver to the arduino so that I can outsource the code into it and run it. Before all of that, I needed a power source for the motor driver. So I went and used 4 double A batteries to power the driver. Not only that, I did some research on how to wire the micro servo and the ultrasonic sensors to the arduino. As a result, I wired those together and began with coding. Now my robot was able to make the turns that I set out for it to do.
